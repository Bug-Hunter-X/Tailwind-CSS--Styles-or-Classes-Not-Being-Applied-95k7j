# Tailwind CSS: Styles or Classes Not Being Applied

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS fails to pick up custom styles or classes in a project. The problem typically stems from an incorrect or missing `content` property in the `tailwind.config.js` file, or incorrect file paths.

## Problem

Tailwind CSS is not applying custom styles or classes that have been defined.  This results in the styles not appearing on the page as expected.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the `content` property in `tailwind.config.js` correctly points to all files where Tailwind classes are used. Incorrect paths or missing files in this array are the most frequent causes.  Additionally, double check your configuration to ensure no typos exist.
