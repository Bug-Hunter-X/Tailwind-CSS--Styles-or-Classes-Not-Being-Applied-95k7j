```javascript
// In your Tailwind CSS configuration file (tailwind.config.js)
module.exports = {
  content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'], // Make sure this includes all your HTML and component files
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'custom-blue': '#007bff', //Example custom color
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```
This configuration is missing the content array or has an incorrect path. Tailwind needs to know where to find the classes being used in your project. Make sure the path to your html and component files is correct and that you have included all files in your project.

Another issue may be that the `content` property isn't properly configured. If you are using frameworks like Vue, React, or Svelte, you may need to adjust the configuration to match your project structure. For instance, if your components are located in a `src` directory, you'll need to adjust the paths within the `content` array accordingly.
